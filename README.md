# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository focuses on **Heart Disease Prediction** using Machine Learning. The model analyzes the impact of **chest pain intensity** and **heart rate (BPM)** on heart disease, helping in early detection and prevention.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🏗️
- NumPy 🔢
- Scikit-Learn 🤖
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🌊

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Heart Disease Dataset**: Includes vital heart parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and heart rate (BPM).

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹 - Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍 - Understanding patterns and risk factors.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** 🎯 - Implementing ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
4. **Prediction & Conclusion** 📈 - Assessing model performance and drawing insights.
